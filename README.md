# hrms-restapi-springdata
A simple Human Resource management System(HRMS) Rest-API made with SpringBoot and SpringData (spring-data-rest and spring-data-jpa dependencies) that performs Rest CRUD operations with a simple SQL database of employees.

Note- Before running this Maven project in an IDE, it is required to run the SQL scripts in MySQLWorkbench (or other sql-dbms-tool).
